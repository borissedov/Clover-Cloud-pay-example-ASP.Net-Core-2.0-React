# Example Remote Pay Cloud POS in ASP.Net Core-2.0 with React 

This example is a full-featured, web-based point-of-sale system developed in [React](https://reactjs.org/) that uses the Clover Cloud Connector APIs to perform all POS actions.

You can clone this repository and run the application locally.

    npm install
    
This will start a local server on port 3000. You can then navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
